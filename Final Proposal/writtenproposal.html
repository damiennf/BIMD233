        For my final project, I plan on making a portfolio piece of the work that we did
        in this class. As I do not have many artistic or material hobbies, I am choosing to instead
        focus on the labs we did in class. I will be putting the most time into my "About Me" page, which will include
        more information on my likes and hobbies that do not have tangible things to show in a portfolio.
        My portfolio website will have 3 pages, not including the Lab and midterm links. There will be a main page, which
        will be my index.html and will showcase an overview of the other web pages. There will be an "About
        Me" page, which will be the information about me, who I am, my interests, and showcase pictures and
        videos of things I enjoy doing. Lastly, there will be a contact page with my information, including
        where I'm from, the school I attend, an embedded pdf link to my resume, and my contacts.<br/><br/>

        I plan on doing a dark theme with red highlights for my page design. For my page alignment,
        I plan on doing a linear, centered alignment, although I may also do an alternating alignment to
        have more variety. I plan on having my landing page be a large header, and have an animation when
        scrolling down to see the rest of the landing page. I also would like to have a custom animation
        at the top of my header page, specifically having my header which says "Hi, I'm Damien" type out
        as if I was actively typing it. I plan on using CSS to make standardized text sizes and container
        sizes, so that everything is aligned even between pages. I also plan on using a navbar and a 
        page footer to have more quick links and quick contacts.<br/><br/>

        My repository in the background will simply have my index.html as the landing page, with links to
        each Lab from this class through both a dropdown menu and on the landing page as quick links. There will
        be an image and video folder, a css folder for my css files, and a javascript folder for my javascript files.
        My inspiration for this final design comes from multiple sources. The color scheme is based on my favorite 
        colors, and my page design and alignment is inspired by Discord's desktop app, which has a very sleek 
        and professional look, as well as many animations and features that are not invasive to the user. The bulk of 
        the design for my page will be thought of by me, as I enjoy taking the time to craft something from my imagination.
