        For my final project, I plan on making a portfolio piece of the work that we did
        in this class. As I do not have many artistic or material hobbies, I am choosing to instead
        focus on the labs we did in class, and putting the most time in my about me page which will include
        more information on my likes and hobbies that do not have tangible things to show in a portfolio.
        My page will have , not including the Lab links. There will be a main page, which
        will be my index.html and will showcase an overview of the other web pages. There will be an about
        me page, which will be the information about me, who I am, my interests, and showcase pictures and
        videos of things I enjoy doing. I am planning on having a contact page with my information, including
        where I'm from, the school I attend, an embedded pdf link to my resume, and my contacts.

        I am planning on doing a dark theme with red highlights for my page design. For my page alignment,
        I plan on doing a linear, centered alignment, although I may also do an alternating alignment to
        have more variety. I plan on having my landing page be a large header, and have an animation when
        scrolling down to see the rest of the landing page. I also would like to have a custom animation
        at the top of my header page, specifically having my header which says "Hi, I'm Damien" type out
        as if I was actively typing it. I plan on using CSS to make standardized text sizes and container
        sizes, so that everything is aligned even between pages. I also plan on using a navbar and a 
        page footer to have more quick links and quick contacts.

        My repository in the background will simply have my index.html as the landing page, with links to
        each Lab from this class through both a dropdown menu and on the landing page as quick links. There will
        be an image and video folder, a css folder for my css files, and a javascript folder for my javascript files.
